<h1>My Learnings</h1>

# Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications. Some key points I've learned about Next.js include:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO.
- Static site generation (SSG) for generating pre-rendered HTML pages at build time.
- API routes for building API endpoints within the same Next.js application.
- Automatic code splitting for optimized loading of JavaScript bundles.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without writing custom CSS. Here are some of my learnings about Tailwind CSS:

- Utility-first approach allows for rapid prototyping and consistent design.
- Responsive design made easy with built-in classes like `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.
- Customization options using Tailwind configuration file for colors, spacing, and more.
- JIT mode for just-in-time compilation to reduce CSS bundle size.

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Here's what I've learned about Git:

- Basics of Git workflow including `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
- Branching and merging strategies for collaborative development.
- Using Git tags for versioning releases.
- Resolving merge conflicts and reverting changes with Git commands.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It helps catch errors early during development and improves code quality and maintainability. Some key learnings about TypeScript include:

- Declaring types using primitives, interfaces, enums, and unions.
- Strict mode for enforcing stricter type checking.
- Type inference to automatically infer types based on usage.
- Integrating TypeScript with popular frameworks like React and Node.js.
